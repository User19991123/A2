=== Module Description ===
This module contains the basic tree interface required by the treemap
visualiser. You will both add to the abstract class, and complete a
concrete implementation of a subclass to represent files and folders on your
computer's file system.

class TMTree:
    """A TreeMappableTree: a tree that is compatible with the treemap
    visualiser.

    This is an abstract class that should not be instantiated directly.

    You may NOT add any attributes, public or private, to this class.
    However, part of this assignment will involve you implementing new public
    *methods* for this interface.
    You should not add any new public methods other than those required by
    the client code.
    You can, however, freely add private methods as needed.

    === Public Attributes ===
    rect:
        The pygame rectangle representing this node in the treemap
        visualization.
    data_size:
        The size of the data represented by this tree.

    === Private Attributes ===
    _colour:
        The RGB colour value of the root of this tree.
    _name:
        The root value of this tree, or None if this tree is empty.
    _subtrees:
        The subtrees of this tree.
    _parent_tree:
        The parent tree of this tree; i.e., the tree that contains this tree
        as a subtree, or None if this tree is not part of a larger tree.
    _expanded:
        Whether or not this tree is considered expanded for visualization.

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - data_size >= 0
    - If _subtrees is not empty, then data_size is equal to the sum of the
      data_size of each subtree.

    - _colour's elements are each in the range 0-255.

    - If _name is None, then _subtrees is empty, _parent_tree is None, and
      data_size is 0.
      This setting of attributes represents an empty tree.

    - if _parent_tree is not None, then self is in _parent_tree._subtrees

    - if _expanded is True, then _parent_tree._expanded is True
    - if _expanded is False, then _expanded is False for every tree
      in _subtrees
    - if _subtrees is empty, then _expanded is False
